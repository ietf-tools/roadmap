# IETF Tools Roadmap

:sparkle: View the [IETF Tools Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/ietf-tools/projects/9)

**NOTE** Until this comment is removed, the contents of this repository should
be considered as an early draft.

This repository is used to communicate the IETF Tools Team roadmap. 

It is designed to drive conversation about what the roadmap _should be_, but
the issues and discussions section of this repository are not where that
conversation should take place. Contribution directly to this repository is intentionally restricted. (Compare this to [GitHub's public roadmap repository](https://github.com/github/roadmap)).

Discussion of changes to the roadmap should take place at
tools-discuss@ietf.org.

Issues with individual tools should be reported to their [respective repositories](https://github.com/ietf-tools/).
